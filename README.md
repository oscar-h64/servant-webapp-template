# Template for Servant Webapps

***WORK IN PROGRESS***

This repository contains a template Haskell web application application which is powered by Servant, and uses:
- [Persistent](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent) for the database (using PostgreSQL)
- [The Shakesperian templates](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shakespeare) for the pages
- [Servant-Auth](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant-auth) for authentication
